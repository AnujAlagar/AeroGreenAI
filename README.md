AeroGreen AI is an AI-powered smart agriculture simulation platform designed to optimize irrigation, monitor crop growth, detect pest threats, and enable autonomous drone response for sustainable farming.

This project demonstrates a scalable 10-acre intelligent tomato farm ecosystem that integrates:
🌤 Weather-aware irrigation
💧 Dynamic soil moisture modeling
🍅 Real-time tomato growth lifecycle simulation
🐀 Rodent detection & pesticide response
🚁 Autonomous drone surveillance
📷 Distributed multi-camera monitoring
📊 Web-based farmer dashboard
The system is built entirely in Python and runs in a browser, making it deployable, mobile-compatible, and hardware-agnostic.

🌍 **Problem Statement**
Modern agriculture faces critical challenges:
Over-irrigation leading to water wastage
Unpredictable climate conditions
Delayed pest detection
Crop losses due to rodents
Manual field monitoring inefficiencies
Excessive pesticide usage
Small and medium farmers often lack affordable intelligent automation systems.

AeroGreen AI aims to simulate a scalable, AI-driven, sustainable farm management ecosystem.

🧠 **Core System Capabilities**
1️⃣ Climate-Aware Irrigation Engine
Soil moisture decreases naturally over time.
Daily rain probability is simulated.
If rain is expected → irrigation is postponed.
If moisture drops below threshold → irrigation is triggered.
Prevents unnecessary water consumption.
Decision Logic
if soil_moisture < 30 and not rain_today:
    irrigation = "Start Irrigation"

elif rain_probability > 70:
    irrigation = "Delay Irrigation"
    
2️⃣ Realistic Tomato Growth Lifecycle Simulation
The system models biological crop growth over time.
Growth Stages
Stage	Days	Visual Change
Seedling	0–4	Small green stem
Flowering	5–9	Yellow flowers
Green Fruit	10–19	Small green tomatoes
Ripening	20–29	Orange tomatoes
Ripe	30+	Fully red tomatoes
🕒 1 farm day = 10 real-world seconds.
Plant height increases dynamically as days progress.

3️⃣ Rodent Detection & Autonomous Response
Rodent events occur only during fruit-bearing stages.
When detected:
🚨 Zone flagged
🚁 Drone dispatched automatically
🧪 Pesticide protocol simulated
📊 Farmer alerted in dashboard

4️⃣ Autonomous Drone Surveillance
The drone:
Patrols farm continuously
Moves in circular route during normal conditions
Redirects to affected zone when rodent detected
Simulates targeted intervention

5️⃣ Distributed Camera Monitoring
5 surveillance poles are positioned:
4 quadrant cameras (each covers ~2.5 acres)
1 central monitoring camera
The layout ensures complete 10-acre visibility.

**Simulation Engine Design**
Each farm day (10 seconds):
1️⃣ Soil moisture reduces
2️⃣ Weather probability generated
3️⃣ Rain impact applied
4️⃣ Irrigation decision executed
5️⃣ Rodent event probability checked
6️⃣ Drone target assigned
7️⃣ Plant growth updated
This mimics real agricultural cycles.
